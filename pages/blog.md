5.27.25:
Planning an event soon at Brentwood's Gateway Portal.  CFW has had past events at both old locations on Gateway & Venice Blvd, so it's exciting to get back after more than a year of doing these.  Details coming, but will once again be a stream of consciousness...
* opening with music/singing
* a short guided meditation
* exploring future and past timelines using much of Dolores' suggestions as a guiding light
* ...and lots of sharing and discussion time.
* closing with more music.

5.27.25:
Planning an event soon at Brentwood's Gateway Portal.  CFW has had past events at both old locations on Gateway & Venice Blvd, so it's exciting to get back after more than a year of doing these.  Details coming, but will once again be a stream of consciousness...
* opening with music/singing
* a short guided meditation
* exploring future and past timelines using much of Dolores' suggestions as a guiding light
* ...and lots of sharing and discussion time.
* closing with more music.

-recollecting: when I went through QHHt training 15 years ago at a Burbank hotel it was a week of bliss being with Dolores and the other burgeoning practitioners -- a slice of heaven.  When the last day of the seminar came and got a pic with her (in about section), she explained to each of us how we need to stay with it and work at it -- felt like she was almost hurt saying it in that she knew many of us would just done the training and moved on to other things.  I felt that pain.  I knew I'd do my part and try to do many sessions.  She was so special, we owe her that much.  I saw Dolores leaving that day and she had a look of arriving more than leaving -- a big smile on her face.  There seemed to always be a light enveloping her.  I was saying to myself when I saw her smiling, "will I ever feel that good...probably not".  I think now I'm thinking about how she got that way -- the decades she dedicated to helping people (daily at least one session when she was in her home town of Huntsville, AL).  She spent the last few years out in the oceans on cruise ships doing group stuff.  In my work doing the eco-adventure app (SurfGod HtB for iOS) doing talks about it & being a speaker for Heal the Bay, I was so happy the ocean had found her and the healing that must've gone on out at sea.  Incidentally, I'm working on rebooting SurfGod HtB for another round (VR/AR, handhelds, computers, surfaces, and whatever else we can get it on) -- pray for me that I don't go broke again doing this.  I love the ocean and want to be one of the many that are trying to change the way we are behaving on this planet.  more at www.torridgames.com.

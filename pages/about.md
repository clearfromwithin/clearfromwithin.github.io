Greetings.  Welcome to Clear From Within. It can be stated that all healing starts from within ourselves.  Sometimes within <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">seems</span> out of reach, or we may experience blocks that keep us from going inside on our own.  We search and search for answers out in the external world.  Often the solution simply requires a person to facilitate this going within to help us achieve our heart’s desires and to find clarity.  This is what I endeavor to do with clients.  I always try my best to lead with love, attentiveness, and dilligence.

My name is Matt Fairweather.  I offer a variety of services in Wellness/Health.

Services:
* QHHt (practitioner for 15yrs, Level 1 & 2 trained, both in person by the late, great author/teacher/regressionist Dolores Cannon who pioneered the technique).  This ground-breaking technique offers much clearing and Dolores herself said that one QHHt session many times may be all that is needed.  Usually clients will have an amazing healing in their first sesion and also many will have a clearer vision of their life's mission. For those that may wish or require I will also mix in a breathing intro (yoga/rebirthing) as a precursor which tends to settle the mind/body. Psst...one thing however that I've noted in working with hundreds of clients is that it is integral to stay on top of things -- we can get off track very quickly with the litany of external distractions. Dolores and many other wisdom keepers have the same message: "the here and now is all there is" -- the more we are able to put this into practice the healthier in mind/body we are.  To support you in your mission on planet Earth you may want to look into the below items (or whatever keeps you humming along to stay on top of things after your session...jusayin :). I also do integrative approaches remotely if youre not in the LA area applying much of the below modalities.
* VocalYoga (credentialed by Heather Lyle vocalyoga.com)
* Biologicx/Peptides (studying/utilizing peptides and other advanced biologics under the tutelage of doctors highly-specialized in this field. my particular interests lie with weightloss/body-sculpting/healing/wellness/mind. I have been working with clients for 5 years assisting them and working toward their goals. I operate on my own, but within a network of like-minded wellness concierges equally passionate about this field of study & practice.
* Yoga (teacher, groups and individial, as of 2019.  I practice daily myself for 20 years in areas of Ashtanga/Iyengar/Kundalini/Hatha/PowerYoga with highly advanced, serious teachers including Marla Apt, Chad Hamrin & Vinnie Marino)
* Self-enquiry/I/Isness (practicing and working with others for 16 years. Studied heavily the works of Nisargadatta Maharaj, Lester Levensen, Sri Ramana Maharshi, Tony Parsons and Robert Adams.  I also developed Abundance Course App for iOS/Android with Release Technique,LLP).  In 2016, I was teacher trained in Sedona,AZ to be a Releasing Facilitator (derivative of methods pioneered by Lester Levenson to release all emotional blocks) with teachers ordained by Lester Levenson(1909-1994) himself [CFR](https://www.facebook.com/CenterforReleasing/).  To demystify idea with Enquiry it is very simple -- questions are presented to allow for space and solutions to present themselves.
* Meditation (20 years, started with nothingness meditation and gone from there to many different modalities including Tibetan Buddhism as a student of Sherab Khandro(Ani) of Santa Monica KTC, taking refuge in the tradition of the Karmapa, Ogyen Trinley Dorje [www.kagyuoffice.org](https://www.kagyuoffice.org)

I also develop paleo/non-glut/keto diet friendly dishes and deserts yet I like most all foods and don't discriminate :) if it taste good I say pay attention and how does it make you REALY feel.
* Chef.  Professionally at Red Door in Bel Air, private events/dinners, as an apprentice for Chef Thea Dixon in the LA area, and for dinner parties I host at my home.  I also have a history in food servics for Marriotts in Herndon,VA & SLC, UT -- also at The Diplomat @Dulles Int'l Airport, VA.

Cynthia’s career began in fashion, designing innovative, functional clothing for Versatile Fashions from 1996 to 2008—designs that were later cataloged at Harvard University for their cultural and artistic relevance.

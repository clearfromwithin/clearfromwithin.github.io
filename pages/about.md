Greetings.  Welcome to Clear From Within.  It can be stated that all healing starts from within ourselves.  Sometimes within seems out of reach, or we may experience blocks that keep us from going inside on our own.  We search and search for answers out in the external world.  Often the solution simply requires a person to facilitate this going within to help us achieve our heartâ€™s desires and to find clarity.  This is what I endeavor to do with clients.  I always try my best to lead with love, attentiveness, and dilligence.

My name is Matt Fairweather.  I offer a variety of services in Wellness/Health.

Services:
* QHHt (practitioner for over a decade, Level 1 & 2 trained, both in person by the late, great author/teacher/regressionist Dolores Cannon who pioneered the technique).  This ground-breaking technique offers much clearing and Dolores herself said that one QHHt session many times may be all that is needed.  Usually clients will have an amazing healing in their first sesion and also a life trajectory, mission as it were, is revealed to the client.  Psst...one thing however that I've noted in working with hundreds of clients is that they need to stay on top of things.  We humans can get off track very quickly as there's many distractions in our world.  To support you in your mission on planet Earth you may want to look into the below items (or whatever keeps you humming along) to stay on top of things...jusayin :)
* VocalYoga (credentialed by Heather Lyle vocalyoga.com)
